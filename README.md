# Java High Performance [Video]
This is the code repository for [Java High Performance [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/java-high-performance-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Java 12 comes with a host of new features and APIs with lots of ready-to-use components to help you build efficient and scalable applications. You will leverage JFR (Java Flight Recorder) to test the performance of your applications and learn about general Java performance practices and improvements introduced in Java 12.

In this hands-on course, you will build a data-processing application and improve its performance in every section as you progress through the course. You will use the AOT compiler and JShell to prototype your Java code. Moving on, you will be introduced to multithreading and will learn about concurrent programming to build highly concurrent and efficient applications. 

By the end of the course, you will be able to build high-performance and efficient applications optimized in various aspects of Java.
